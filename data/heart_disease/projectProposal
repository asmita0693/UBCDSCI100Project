Title: Predict heart disease classification level based on age, sex, maximum heart rate achieved and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

Introduction
The data set Heart Disease Switzerland will be used. The processed dataset is available on github. The purpose of analysis of this project is to explore the relationship between age, sex, maximum heart rate achieved by the patient and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
